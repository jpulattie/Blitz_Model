# Blitz_Model

This is a Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Model project, built in Python with JupyterLab.  The purpose of this model
is to manipulate, explore, and predict defensive play calls in a high school football game.  All data has been labeled from a
high school football game, exported to a CSV, and read by this project.  The goal of this project is to find correlations and
predict when a team may blitz.  

This project is built in python using matplotlib, sklearn, pandas, and Jupyterlab.
