## Overview

I built this project to explore data analytics in Python using real life data from my current work as a football coach.  This 
is a Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Model project, built in Python with JupyterLab.  The purpose of this model
is to manipulate, explore, and predict defensive play calls in a high school football game.  All data has been labeled from a
high school football game, exported to a CSV, and read by this project.  The goal of this project is to find correlations and
predict when a team may blitz. </br>
 </br>
The number of data points is extremely limited, but I wanted to explore real life uses of Python. I took breakdown data from our 
team's current opponent video and explored it in this notebook. The feature that I enjoyed learning about the most was using the 
heat map to find trends.  As a coach with a decade worth of experience, the insights that stand out are the things that I don't
notice in watching the film.  Using the heat maps in this project, I noticed there was a higher correlation of run blitzes.  This was not something that I had noticed from breaking down opponent film, but I did glean that insight from the data. </br>

### Built With

This project is built in python using matplotlib, sklearn, pandas, and Jupyterlab.

## Features

This project takes a data set, adjusts the columns to numerical data points, creates a Linear Regression Model, and creates a Random Forest Model.
